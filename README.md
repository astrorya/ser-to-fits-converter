# ser-to-fits-converter
Convert each frame from a .ser file into individual .fits files.

To use this script, you'll need these dependencies:
python 3.8,
pySER-Reader (here: https://github.com/Copper280z/pySER-Reader/tree/master),
numpy,
astropy,

Using the script is simple:
type into your terminal:

$ python ser_to_fits_converter.py (your .ser files)

My method has been moving all of the .ser files that I want to convert into .fits files into the same folder, and using *.ser in place of "(your .ser files)".
Feel free to post issues and I will get to them when I can.
